# Preprocessing

NetCDF4 files, commonly used for storing climate and earth systems data, are not optimized for use with most machine learning applications with heavy io requirements or datasets that are simply too large to hold in GPU/CPU memory. ClimatExML uses [nc2pt](https://github.com/nannau/nc2pt) to resolve this issue. It performs a preprocessing flow on climate fields and converts them from NetCDF4 (`.nc`) to an intermediate file format Zarr (`.zarr`) which allows for the parallel loading and writing to individual PyTorch Lightning files (`.pt`) that can be loaded directly onto GPUs.

## What intended use cases of nc2pt?
* standardizing and making metadata uniform between datasets

* aligns different grids perfectly by re-projecting them onto one another -- nc2pt projects the low-resolution (lr) regular grids onto the high-resolution curvilinear grids (hr). nc2pt assumes the curvilinear dimensions are like `rlat` or `rlon`. It was originally designed to support super-resolution problems.

* selects individual years as test years or training years

* organizes code into input (lr) or output (hr) fields

* meant for use with large datasets ont he order of hundreds of GB

## What preprocessing steps does nc2pt do? 🤔

1. configures metadata between the datasets as defined in the config
2. slices data to a pre-determined range of dates
3. aligns the grids via interpolation, crops them to be the same size, and coarsens the low-resolution fields by the configured scale factor
4. applies user defined transforms like unit conversions or log transformations
5. splits into a train and test dataset and standardizes both datasets based on the mean and standard deviation of all grids from the training data only (also writes this information into the zarr metadata for inference)
6. writes to `.zarr`
7. `nc2pt/tools/zarr_to_torch.py` - writes to PyTorch files
8. `nc2pt/tools/single_file_to_batches.py` - batches the single PyTorch files

## What are the downsides of using PyTorch files for climate data?
The most obvious downside is that you lose the metadata associated with a netCDF dataset. The intermediate Zarr format produced by nc2pt allows for parallelized io and perserves the metadata. This is useful for inference. 


## Requirements
* [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) with Python >= 3.8
* [xESMF](https://xesmf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)



### 💽 Installation
xESMF is only available through Conda, so you will have to be able to install conda on your system. Unfortunately, this is limiting because certain HPCs don't allow conda.

1. Begin by install xESMF here in a conda environment: [xESMF](https://xesmf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

2. Clone this repository

3. Install into your conda environment

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
# editable install
pip install -e nc2pt/
```

That's it!

### 📋 Configuration
nc2pt uses [hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for configuring and by instantiating structured classes in `nc2pt/climatedata.py`. This simeultaneously defines the workflow as well as the data. Please see `nc2pt/conf/config.yml` for an example configuration, or below:

### 🚀 Running
1. Explore data and ensure compatibility
2. Configure `nc2pt/conf/config.yaml`
3. Run the `nc2pt/preprocess.py` script which will run through your preprocessing steps. This creates the zarr files
4. Run the `nc2pt/tools/zarr_to_torch.py` script which serializes each time step in the `.zarr` file to an individual PyTorch `.pt` file.
5. Optional: run the `nc2pt/tools/single_files_to_batches.py` which combines individual files from the previous step into random batches. This setup allows for less io in your machine learning pipeline.

### Testing

Testing is done with pytest. The easiest way to perform tests is to install pytest and use the command: `pytest --cov-report term-missing --cov=nc2pt .`

It will generate a coverage report and automatically use files prepended with `test_*.py` in `nc2pt/tests`
